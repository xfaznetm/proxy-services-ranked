## **[SOAX](https://soax.com)**

AI-powered routing with 191M+ clean IPs and proprietary infrastructure.

![SOAX Screenshot](image/soax.webp)


SOAX differentiates itself through ethical sourcing—all residential and mobile IPs come from users who explicitly opted in through transparent consent models. This approach ensures cleaner IPs with better reputations and lower block rates compared to providers using questionable acquisition methods. The proprietary infrastructure and exclusive ISP agreements create a fully managed, first-party network rather than recycled third-party pools.

The proxy pool includes 155M+ residential IPs, 33M+ mobile IPs, and 2.6M+ USA ISP proxies plus shared and dedicated datacenter options. Geographic coverage spans 195 countries with targeting by city, ASN, and ISP. HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols give you flexibility for different use cases and software requirements.

**AI and machine learning optimization:** Smart proxy rotation automatically selects the most efficient IP based on your target domain, request history, and success rate.

The system learns from patterns to improve routing decisions over time, effectively making your proxy usage more efficient as you use the service.

Residential proxies rotate by default with refresh rates from 1 to 60 minutes, or you can enter custom durations. Sticky IPs disable automatic rotation when you need consistent identity across sessions. Requests cap at 1,000 per second per plan, with port access limited to 80 and 443 unless your use case requires others. KYC verification, usage restriction to pre-approved ethical applications, and continuous monitoring prevent abuse that damages IP reputation.

## **[Proxy-Cheap](https://www.proxy-cheap.com)**

Static and rotating proxies with flexible performance characteristics.

![Proxy-Cheap Screenshot](image/proxy-cheap.webp)


Proxy-Cheap delivers both static and rotating residential proxies optimized for different use cases and performance requirements. Static proxies provide fixed IP addresses with consistent high-speed performance, often running on datacenter infrastructure with 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps connections. These work great when you need reliable identity persistence across sessions without constant IP changes.

Rotating proxies automatically switch between different IPs either per request, after several requests, or at specific intervals. Elite Level 1 proxies strip headers like "Authorization," "From," and "Proxy-Authorization" for maximum anonymity. The constant rotation makes tracking difficult, improving security for sensitive operations. Websites struggle to flag patterns when your fingerprint changes continuously.

The maintenance contrast matters—static proxies need attention because websites eventually flag or block them, requiring manual replacement and rotation logic. Rotating proxies handle maintenance automatically through built-in IP changes that prevent most blocks. Static options come in shared or dedicated versions, with dedicated giving exclusive IP use for better reliability, performance, and reduced blacklist risk.

Pricing structure accommodates different budget levels with transparent costs per proxy or bandwidth. The platform focuses on delivering working proxies rather than flashy features, appealing to technically skilled users who prefer straightforward service over complicated dashboards. Response times and success rates meet expectations for the price point, making Proxy-Cheap solid for users prioritizing value.

## **[Rayobyte](https://rayobyte.com)**

Ethical sourcing with city targeting and non-expiring packages.

![Rayobyte Screenshot](image/rayobyte.webp)


Rayobyte emphasizes ethical IP sourcing and transparent business practices, ensuring all residential and mobile IPs come from consenting users. This approach maintains better IP reputations and reduces block rates compared to providers using aggressive collection methods. The smaller pool size compared to giants like Bright Data gets offset by higher IP quality and cleaner reputations.

Non-expiring traffic packages stand out as a major differentiator—unused bandwidth rolls over indefinitely rather than disappearing at month-end. This eliminates pressure to consume traffic before expiration and reduces waste for users with variable monthly usage. City-level targeting provides geographic precision for localized testing, ad verification, and market research.

The platform serves residential, datacenter, ISP, and mobile proxies with unlimited bandwidth options for users who need predictable costs regardless of consumption. Scalable pay-as-you-go plans accommodate growth from startup to enterprise without forced migrations between service tiers. The dashboard provides straightforward proxy management without overwhelming users with excessive options.

Rayobyte's focus on ethical practices and customer-friendly policies appeals to businesses concerned about compliance and long-term sustainability. While not the cheapest option, the combination of quality IPs, flexible expiration policies, and responsive support creates value beyond raw per-GB pricing. Users prioritizing reliability and ethics over maximum pool size find Rayobyte meets their requirements effectively.

## FAQ

**How do ISP proxies differ from residential proxies for account management?**

ISP proxies combine residential IP authenticity with datacenter stability and speed, making them ideal for managing multiple accounts long-term. They maintain the same IP for 12-24 hours without rotation, appear as legitimate residential connections to platforms, and deliver consistent performance without the slowdowns common in peer-to-peer residential networks. For social media management, e-commerce, or any scenario requiring stable identity across extended sessions, ISP proxies outperform rotating residential options.

**Which proxy type works best for large-scale web scraping projects?**

Rotating residential proxies excel at large-scale scraping because they automatically change IPs with each request or session, distributing requests across millions of addresses to avoid rate limits and blocks. Look for providers with 50M+ IP pools, 99%+ success rates, and intelligent rotation that adjusts based on target site behavior. For sites with aggressive anti-bot measures, premium providers like Bright Data, SOAX, or Oxylabs deliver higher success rates that justify their pricing through reduced failures and faster completion times.

**What determines whether static or rotating proxies suit my use case better?**

Static proxies work when you need consistent identity—account management, authentication-required tasks, long-term monitoring, or scenarios where frequent IP changes trigger security flags. Rotating proxies fit data collection, anonymity-focused browsing, avoiding detection through diversity, and high-volume operations where IP bans from individual addresses don't halt entire workflows. Consider maintenance too: static proxies need manual monitoring and replacement, while rotating proxies maintain themselves through automatic IP changes.
